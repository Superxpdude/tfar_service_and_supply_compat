# TFAR S&S Compat
This small compatibility patch provides configuration data to allow the S&S Radio backpacks to act as long-range backpacks when used with TFAR. This includes (but is not limited to) the following backpacks:
* Kombat (Radio)
* Motherlode (Radio)
* Predator (Radio)

Requires [Service and Supply](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2183975396) and [TFAR](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=894678801).

## Development
To build the TFAR CUP Compat, you will need to have a version of [HEMTT](https://github.com/synixebrett/HEMTT) installed on your computer, or placed in the project directory.

Building can be done by using the `build.bat` file, or by opening a command prompt/powershell window and entering `hemtt build`.
